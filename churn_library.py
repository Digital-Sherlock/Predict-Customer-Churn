'''
This module converts churn_notebook.ipynb into a modular code that
is easy to test and debug. It includes functions for:
1) importing the data
2) performing EDA
3) encoding cat data
4) performing feature engineering
5) training a model
6) generating classification report
7) plotting feature importance
