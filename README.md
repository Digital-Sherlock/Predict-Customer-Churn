## Files and data description

Final version of the project will provide with the following results:

- Project description (README.md)
- Dataset (data/)
- EDA analysis contributing to a problem understanding (images/eda)
- Model performance analysis (images/results)
- Main script (churn_library.py)
- Tests for main script (churn_script_logging_and_tests.py)
- Main script OOP-refactored (churn_library_refactored.py)
- Tests for refactored main script (churn_script_logging_and_tests_refactored.py)
- Constants for refactored script (contstants.py)
- Module dedicated for data importing, encoding, and EDA (data_operations.py)
- Module for model training, saving, and prediction analysis (model_training.py)
- Saved models (models/)
- Testing logs (logs/)

## Running Files

### Main script execution

Example of script execution assuming it's done in a virtual environment: **pipenv run python3 churn_library.py**

Same principal applies for runnning churn_library_refactored.py.

### Main script testing

Example of script testing execution assuming it's done in a virtual environment: **pipenv run python3 churn_script_logging_and_tests.py**

Same principal applies for runnning churn_script_logging_and_tests.py.
